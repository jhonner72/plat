'''Warning: Untested and instable component!

This component uses OSGi and blueprint to interact with Camel. 

It uses the OSGi Framework to retrieve the `ProcessEngine` and a `DefaultCamelContext` therefore the bean definition of the `CamelServiceImpl` is obsolete.

The camunda-bpm-osgi project is used with the blueprint-wrapper `context.xml`. The `BlueprintELResolver` was extended by the `CamelBlueprintELResolver`. You need to replace the class of the ‘blueprintELResolver’ bean in the context.xml:

```
...
<bean id="blueprintELResolver" class=" org.camunda.bpm.camel.blueprint.CamelBlueprintELResolver" />
...
```
